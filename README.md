This repository contains solutions for Assignment 2 of Module 3: Control Structures in Python. It includes two Python scripts: one that checks whether a user-inputted number is even or odd using if-else statements, and another that calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. These tasks demonstrate foundational control structures in Python such as conditional statements and iterative loops. Each script is simple, beginner-friendly, and includes appropriate user interaction and output. Please review the code, test the scripts, and ensure all edge cases are handled before submission.
